## Hello!<br>
**If you're here, you're possibly considering me for a position in your company.**<br>
**Thank you for your time and for giving me a chance!**

### Academic work

<br>
I highly encourage you to check out my thesis (written in Polish) - I had quite fun writing it and in the worst-case 
scenario you'll see some funky pictures created by a generative adversarial network. I've also attached pictures of my 
dog and a few bad puns, so I highly recommend it.

Brief summary: I used [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) (style-based GAN architecture) to create GAN 
generating impressionist paintings.<br>


### My professional work:

Unfortunately, most of the projects I worked on aren't open source but there's one I'd gladly share. 
OpenVINOâ„¢ Model Server (OVMS) is a high-performance system for serving machine learning models 
(see more: [OpenVINO Model Server](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server)).

Within this repository, I refactored plenty of legacy code and contributed to code reviews. 
Refactor of this repository happened while simultaneously tests were used - so it was important to not break their 
execution at any time.

Scope of changes:<br>
* PEP8 and OOP adjustments,
* fix of hard-coded values,
* improvement of code readability,
* implementation of a few features making team's life easier

**Added command wrapper for starting the server with machine learning models - building commands based on test parameters 
rather than using a hardcoded command.**<br>

**Refactor of the fixtures starting OVMS to use previously created command wrapper; removed recurring code, improved 
readability.**<br>

**Add option to control tests by the configuration file and environmental variables - simplifying the execution of tests 
both via IDE and command line.**<br>

**Created classes: Docker, MinioDocker, OvmsDocker to easily handle test objects. Prepared Server class for the future - 
to be able to test OVMS both as a Docker container and binary file within the process on a bare host.**<br>

**Enabled running tests for OVMS as a binary file within a shell and changed the MinIO endpoint (due to slight network 
adjustments). Added dynamic creation of JSON configuration files to handle more test cases.**<br>
